<a>I am a Game Development student from the Netherlands, I am currently studying at Noorderpoort in Groningen.<br>
    I have been making games in Unity for 2.5 years, and i have recently started working in Unreal, using blueprints to make the functionality.
<br>
<br>
Since i have primarily worked with Unity and C#, I have become pretty well versed at working with those. <br>
Programming-wise I don't specialize in anything, and instead I usually do whatever task is at hand, and I like to experiment with different things to see what does and doesn't work. <br>
<br>
<br>
In my past time I like to make music, either by playing guitar, or by making electronic music on my computer, and i have used those skills to work as a sound designer in the game jams that I have participated in. <br>
While working on the game jam projects, I have provided both sound effects and music that were fitting for the games, which you can find on </a><a href="/pages/MusicPage.html">my music page</a>
